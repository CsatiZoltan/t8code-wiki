## Coding Guidelines

### Comments

We use C-Style multiple line comments throughout.

```C++
/* Use this to comment a single line */

// Not this

/* Multiple line comments
 * should start each line with a '*'
 * And end with a new line.
 */

/* Each comment line should start and end with a space. */
/*Because this looks ugly.*/
```
