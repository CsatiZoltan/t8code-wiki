### Documentation

t8code uses [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/) to generate the code documentation. You can build the documentation with

```
make doxygen
```

and then find the generated files in the `/doxygen` subfolder.

You can also find the documentation of our releases on the [t8code website](https://dlr-amr.github.io/t8code/pages/documentation.html).
