## Step 1 - Creating a coarse mesh

In this example we will build our first coarse mesh and write it to `.vtu` files in order to visualize it with `Paraview`.

You will find the code to this example in `example/tutorials/step1_coarsemesh.c` and it creates the executable `example/tutorials/step1_coarsemesh`.

### What is a coarse mesh?

In order to build an adaptive mesh `t8code` actually manages two meshes. The coarse mesh (`cmesh`) and the forest mesh (`forest`).

The coarse mesh is the initial input that describes the geometrical and topological properties of the meshed domain.
It is a classical unstructured mesh as it would be generated by a standard mesh generator such as `gmsh`.
It can be as simple as a single hexahedron specifying a cube domain, or as complex as Billions of tetrahedra, prisms, pyramids and hexahedra
describing an airplane geometry.

We view each element of the coarse mesh as the root of recursive refinement. The `forest` is the collection of these refined
elements. Due to the tree-like nature of recursive refinement, we call the elements of the `cmesh` **trees**.

The `cmesh` will (usually) not change during a computation. 
A `cmesh` can be partitioned among the processes or each process can hold a copy of the complete `cmesh`.
